# SQL Interview Practice

A curated set of SQL interview problems solved with clean, production-style SQL.

## Repository structure
Each problem includes:
- `schema.sql` (table definitions)
- `data.sql` (sample inserts)
- `solution.sql` (final solution)
- `README.md` (problem statement + approach)
- `expected_output.md` (optional)

## SQL Dialect
Default: PostgreSQL (easy to adapt to Snowflake/BigQuery).

## Why this repository
This repository demonstrates how I approach real-world SQL problems:
clean structure, reproducible setup (Docker), and business-oriented solutions
focused on analytics and audience building.

## Topics covered
- CTEs & window functions
- Audience segmentation
- Campaign & retention analytics
- Production-style SQL (Postgres)
