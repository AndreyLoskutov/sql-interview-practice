# SQL Interview Practice

A curated set of SQL interview problems solved with clean, production-style SQL.

## Repository structure
Each problem includes:
- `schema.sql` (table definitions)
- `data.sql` (sample inserts)
- `solution.sql` (final solution)
- `README.md` (problem statement + approach)
- `expected_output.md` (optional)

## Topics
CTEs, window functions, joins, cohort/retention, attribution prep, audience building, data quality checks.

## SQL Dialect
Default: PostgreSQL (easy to adapt to Snowflake/BigQuery).
